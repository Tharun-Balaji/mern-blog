# Blog App

## Overview

This is a MERN stack blog application that allows users to create accounts, view blog posts, and comment on them. Admins have the ability to create, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as manage user comments.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users can sign up, sign in, and sign out.
   - Users can sign in using Google OAuth.
   - Admins can access the dashboard and perform CRUD operations on blog posts.

2. **Blog Post Management**:
   - Admins can create, update, and delete blog posts.
   - Blog posts can include images, which are stored using Firebase.
   - Users can view blog posts and filter/sort them by category and date.

3. **Comment Management**:
   - Users can comment on blog posts and like comments.
   - Users can edit and delete their own comments.
   - Admins can view and manage all comments.

4. **Theming**:
   - Users can switch between dark and light themes.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - The application is designed to be mobile-friendly and responsive.

6. **State Management**:
   - Redux is used for complex state management, and Redux Persist is used for caching.

7. **Routing**:
   - React Router DOM is used for managing routes, including private routes for admins.

8. **Backend**:
   - Express is used for the web server.
   - MongoDB is used as the database, with Mongoose as the ORM.
   - Morgan is used for logging, and bcrypt and JWT are used for authentication and authorization.

  <ScrollToTop />
  <Header />
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    <Route path="/sign-in" element={<SignIn />} />
    <Route path="/sign-up" element={<SignUp />} />
    <Route path="/search" element={<Search />} />
    <Route element={<PrivateRoute />}>
      <Route path="/dashboard" element={<DashBoard />} />
    </Route>
    <Route element={<OnlyAdminPrivateRoute />}>
      <Route path="/create-post" element={<CreatePost />} />
